<span class="Welcome">Welcome to the About Page!</span><br />
<p id="narrative">This is where I will post information about working on the website and reflecting my experience and ideas. Completion of V2. What an awesome experience this
  has been in just a few modules! I have already learned so much and while I haven't implemented everything I wanted to in time for the deadline, I can't wait to get started
  on V3 already! I never knew Web Development could be such a blast!<br />
  After coming across a few things I was having trouble with, such as the transforming and skewing images, I started from scratch a couple times and just took it one line at a time.
  I started to believe that you can manipulate things on the webpage without interfering with other elements using the ID tags (Something I didn't quite grasp in V1). After I realized
  that, it was smooth sailing. From then on, I just worked one page at a time and kept improving little by little, even importing my own text font! I cannot wait to see what V3 has
  in store. As always my changelog can be found below with a brand new entry just for this version! Enjoy!
