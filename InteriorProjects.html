    <span class="firstletterF">F</span>looring tends to scare a lot of people due to all the measuring involved. Let us take care of that for you and make sure the only finger you lift
    is the one to choose which flooring you have your sights set on. Our team will take care of the rest. Flooring has never been easier! Choose a design and get going!
    <p><span class="firstletterT">T</span>o get you started, here is some information on flooring that you might need to know.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="vinyl">Vinyl Plank:</span>  - Although synthetic by origin, vinyl flooring achieves the rich, deep, and elegant look of wooden floors. This floor type also comes in different colors and patterns since
      vinyl manufacturing processes have been upgraded throughout the decades. Vinyl floors are durable and will ably resist impacts and scratches against their surfaces. Vinyl floors are
      cost effective and are the easiest ones to invest on at the outset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="wood">Wood:</span> - Wood flooring is the classic option and it comes in oak, maple, and bamboo. With proper care and maintenance, wood floors can last a long time.
        Cleaning wooden floors only require sweeping and the application of polishing shine solution while scrubbing from time to time. Perfect for the authentic rustic atmosphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="laminate">Laminate:</span>  - Laminate flooring presents itself as an option for those who want to capture the grandeur of wood or stone without breaking the bank. Laminate is hardy and will show no
        signs of fading or stains for a decade. It is not easily affected by moisture like wood and it will require less care than authentic wood or stone flooring.
        Clean-up with a mop or broom.

<article class="Walling">

    <img src="beforeairstone.jpg" id="beforeairstone" alt="Before Airstone" />

    <img src="palletwall.jpg" id="palletwall" alt="Pallet Wall" />
    <span class="firstletterA">A</span>nother option for projects around the house is walls. Most believe it is mainly tearing down or putting up drywall. While we here at
    CBR love being manly and nailing up drywall, there is a lot more to it than you think! Here are previous works that we have completed for your perusal.


    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="airstone">Airstone:</span>  Also called an aquarium bubbler, is a piece of aquarium furniture, traditionally a piece of limewood or porous stone, whose purpose is to gradually
        diffuse air into the tank, eliminating the noise and large bubbles of conventional air filtration systems, and providing other benefits to the health of the fish. "Airstone" is also a
        brand name stone or brick veneer used by homebuilders.<cite>(Definition courtesy of Wikipedia)</cite>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="palletwall">Pallet Wall:</span> Walling made of wooden planks, similar to pallets (hence the awesome name). It takes a skilled professional to make sure the wall is seated properly,
        otherwise it can fall off the wall possibly causing injury. We take pride in the fact that we have done extensive research and inspect each plank individually when hanging to
        ensure that there is no chance of this happening, then each plank is applied to the wall. You can breathe easy knowing that we will take care of the hard parts for you.

    <img src="builtinfinished.jpg" id="builtinafter" alt="Built-in After" />
    <span class="firstletterB">B</span>uilt ins are the kitchen cabinetry or walls, providing a seamless, integrated look for modern kitchens.
    <p><span class="firstletterT">T</span>here is a lot to know about built-ins and each one caters to a different kind of equipment. Therefore, we have to check with
    each customer as every case is different. There are some hurdles you have to get over when trying to go with this type of cabinet, such as making sure that the refrigerator
    has a space to vent. Of course we can go over in detail with you about what you need to know and how we can work together to make your kitchen or other room come alive!</p>
