  <span class="firstletterT">T</span> here is a lot to fencing that we really don't want you to worry about. As the professionals, we will take care of the heavy lifting.
  Everything is pressure treated so that the life of the wood lasts longer and it increases fence life from 8-12 years to 12-14 years. All fences that are crafted may include gate(s)
  depending on your needs as the customer.
  Of course there are ways to customize your experience with us and we cater whatever you want for your project; You are our first priority.
