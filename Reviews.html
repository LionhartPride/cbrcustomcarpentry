<span class="firstletterH">H</span>ere I will display information regarding the customer reviews and some information for the user reading it.

<!-- M6LO3 Demonstrate how to create a table (HTML, explain table's purpose; it needs to be appropriate data for a table, and have at
least 2 columns and 3 rows, appropriate use of thead/tbody/tfooter, and cells using th/td appropriately):   Here I have displayed the HTML usage of a <table>
element with the ID "reviews" showing the header spanning 3 columns and each TD or table data element containing information such as the Customer
name, review, and rating score-->

      and were honest and communicated when we had delays on our gates and post hurricane, good communication is rare. I would 100% recommend them to anybody
      looking for a great priced, well done fence. Thank you guys!"</td>

      (turned out his quote was spot on!). He was great around the kids and even let my daughter help with the staining so she felt like she was part of the project!
      She loves telling people who come over how she "built" those doors. If I could rate CBR 10 stars I would. Give them a shot. You won't be sorry."</td>
